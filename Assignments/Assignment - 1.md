# Assignment 1

## Questions Set 1

1. What is the time complexity of the bubble sort algorithm in the best-case and worst-case scenarios?
2. What is the time complexity of the binary search algorithm in the best-case and worst-case scenarios?
3. How does the bubble sort algorithm work and what are its main drawbacks?
4. How does the binary search algorithm work and why is it more efficient than a linear search?
5. Can the bubble sort algorithm be used to sort a list of floating-point numbers and why or why not?

## Questions Set 2

1. Write a function in Java/C++/Javascript that takes a sorted array of integers and a target value, and uses binary search to find the index of the target value in the array. If the target value is not found in the array, the function should return -1.
2. Write a function in Java/C++/Javascript that takes a list of integers and a target integer, and uses binary search to find the index of the target integer in the list. If the target integer is not found in the list, the function should return the index of the closest integer that is greater than the target integer.
3. Write a function in Java/C++/Javascript that takes a list of integers and applies the bubble sort algorithm to sort the list in descending order.
